Version 0.2, 4th February 2008:
---------------------------------

Added the ability to edit or delete comments.  Also added the ability to 
preview comments (like django.contrib.comments does) and confirm deletion of 
comments.

Also fixed a few bugs, one which was major and made it so that redirection
worked improperly after a new ThreadedComment was posted.

Finally, added max_depth as an attribute to the moderation system, so that
someone cannot vandalize the system by posting a long series of replies to
replies.

Version 0.1.1, 24th January 2008:
---------------------------------

Added get_comment_count and get_free_comment_count templatetags.  Also updated
the manager to have a all_for_object method which gets all related objects
to the given content object.
